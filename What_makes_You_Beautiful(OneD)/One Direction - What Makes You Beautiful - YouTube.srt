1
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,040
You're insecure

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,740
Don't know what for.

3
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,080
You're turning heads when you walk

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,540
through the do-o-or

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,500
Don't need make up

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,040
To cover up

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,040
Being the way that you are

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,000
is enou-o-ough

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Everyone else in the room can see it

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Everyone else but you...

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Baby, you light up my world
like nobody else

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,800
The way that you flip your hair
gets me overwhelmed

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,000
But when you smile at the ground

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,800
It ain't hard to tell

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,500
You don't know
Oh, Oh

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,800
You don't know you're beautiful

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,300
If only you saw
what I can see

18
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,040
You'll understand why
I want you so desperately.

20
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,000
Right now I'm looking at you
And I can't believe

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,500
You don't know
Oh, oh,

23
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,500
You don't know you're beautiful
Oh,oh,

25
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,700
That what makes you beautiful

26
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,200
So c-come on.

27
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,000
You got it wrong.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
To prove I'm right
I put it in a song.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,900
I don't know why

30
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,000
You're being shy,

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,800
And turn away when I look
into your eye-eye-eyes,

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,500
Everyone else in the room can see it.

33
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,500
Everyone else but you.

34
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,700
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else,

35
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,300
The way that you flip your hair
gets me overwhelmed

36
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,200
But when you smile at the ground

37
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,000
It ain't hard to tell

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You don't know
Oh, oh,

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,700
You don't know you're beautiful,

40
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,500
If only you saw
what I can see

41
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,600
You'll understand why
I want you so desperately,

42
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,700
Right now I'm looking at you
and I can't believe,

43
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,000
You don't know,
Oh, oh,

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You don't know you're beautiful
Oh oh,

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That what makes you beautiful.

46
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,500
Baby, you light up my world
like nobody else

47
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,200
The way that you flip your hair
gets me overwhelmed

48
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,300
But when you smile at the ground
It ain't hard to tell.

49
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,500
You don't know
Oh, oh,

50
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,200
You don't know you're beautiful

51
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,850
Baby, you light up my world
like nobody else

52
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,700
The way that you flip your hair
gets me overwhelmed

53
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,450
But when you smile at the ground
It ain't hard to tell.

54
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,100
You don't know
Oh, oh,

55
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,500
You don't know you're beautiful

56
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,000
If only you saw
what I can see

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,900
You'll understand why
I want you so desperately.

59
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,600
You don't know,
Oh, oh,

60
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,000
You don't know you're beautiful
Oh oh,

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You don't know you're beautiful
Oh oh,

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Thats what makes you beautiful.
